"SmartCare is a comprehensive Flutter mobile application that seamlessly connects caregivers with patients, offering intuitive features such as reminders, real-time updates, and a user-friendly interface for efficient caregiving."

Note: Understanding My Work

In this project, I've been working on developing a Flutter mobile application named "SmartCare." The primary goal is to create a caregiving solution connecting caregivers with patients in need of assistance. As of now, I've focused on creating functionalities specifically for caregivers.

I've designed various screens, such as a splash screen, login screen, and a home screen with a navigation drawer. Due to time restrictions, the project is not yet fully completed, and some features are still under development. The login screen features form validation to ensure data integrity.

The home screen includes a dynamic design with an app bar, drawer, and stack layout. The navigation drawer provides easy access to caregiver-specific functionalities. Additionally, I've added two floating action buttons for quick access to information screens.

The "RemainderPage" I've worked on offers functionality for caregivers to manage reminders, allowing them to view all reminders and add new ones. I've included the necessary dependencies for shared preferences, Flutter test, linting, and Firestore for real-time data storage.

The primary color theme is red, providing a visually appealing and consistent user experience.

Furthermore, in the "ScreenHome" class, I've implemented methods for signing out and building drawer items specific to caregivers. The drawer displays caregiver information, including a profile image, name, and clickable links to different sections.

I am using Flutter, Firebase, and Firestore to build this application, ensuring a robust and scalable backend for data storage, retrieval, and real-time updates. The project is structured to accommodate caregivers with specific functionalities tailored to their roles.

Overall, my code structure is clean, and the design is user-friendly, making it a promising foundation for the SmartCare app. I'm looking forward to completing the remaining features and delivering a comprehensive solution for caregivers.
